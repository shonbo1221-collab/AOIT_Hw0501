## 1. Data Preparation
- [x] 1.1 Create `data/` directory structure
- [x] 1.2 Prepare sample dataset (AI-generated vs human-written texts)
- [x] 1.3 Split data into training and testing sets

## 2. Model Development
- [x] 2.1 Create `src/model/` directory
- [x] 2.2 Implement `src/model/train.py` for model training
  - [x] 2.2.1 TF-IDF vectorization
  - [x] 2.2.2 Logistic Regression training
  - [x] 2.2.3 Model serialization (pickle/joblib)
- [x] 2.3 Implement `src/model/predict.py` for inference
- [x] 2.4 Train and save the model

## 3. Streamlit Application
- [x] 3.1 Create `src/app.py` for Streamlit interface
- [x] 3.2 Implement text input area
- [x] 3.3 Add prediction button and result display
- [x] 3.4 Show probability scores and classification
- [x] 3.5 Add visualization (confidence meter, feature importance)

## 4. Dependencies and Configuration
- [x] 4.1 Create `requirements.txt` with dependencies:
  - scikit-learn
  - streamlit
  - pandas
  - numpy
- [x] 4.2 Create README.md with setup instructions

## 5. Testing and Validation
- [x] 5.1 Test model accuracy on test set (100% accuracy achieved)
- [x] 5.2 Validate Streamlit app locally (running at http://localhost:8501)
- [x] 5.3 Test with various text samples (all tests passed)

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

**Summary:**
- Model trained with 100% training accuracy
- Test accuracy: 100% (10/10 samples correct)
- Streamlit app fully functional
- Complete documentation and walkthrough created
