Honestly, I don't get why everyone's obsessed with that new restaurant downtown. Went there last week and waited an hour for a table. The food was okay I guess? Nothing special. Way too expensive for what you get. My friend kept saying it's "Instagram worthy" but like, who cares if the food is just meh.

Been trying to learn guitar for the past month. My fingers hurt so bad! Those calluses everyone talks about? Yeah, they're no joke. But I'm actually starting to play some simple songs now which is pretty cool. Still sound terrible but at least it's recognizable lol.

Why is it so hard to find a decent pair of jeans?? Spent all afternoon shopping and tried on like 20 pairs. Either they fit weird or they're ridiculously expensive. Online shopping is even worse - the sizes are all over the place. Fashion industry really needs to get it together.

My roommate leaves dirty dishes in the sink for DAYS. I've asked nicely, I've left notes, nothing works. At this point I'm just gonna start putting them on their bed. Maybe that'll get the message across. Living with other people is such a pain sometimes.

Just got back from a road trip and wow, gas prices are insane right now. Spent more on gas than on food and hotels combined. Makes me want to just stay home forever. But hey, at least the scenery was nice and we had some good laughs along the way.
